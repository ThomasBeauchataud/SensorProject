# SensorProject
Program to learn how to use Reflection to create complex instances in a factory
## How it works ?
There is sensors, visualizer and converter. Sensor *sense* data and *visualize* them threw a Visualizer. The data can be converted if the unity of the visualizer and the sensor are not the same.

When we create new sensor, we will automacilly associate it a visualizer. The choice of the associated visualizer will depends on the sensor and this visualizer attributes (which specify which unity and type of data each one is managing)
